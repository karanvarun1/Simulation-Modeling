# Simulation-Modeling & Presctiptive Analytics Under Uncertainity
A simulation model built that takes in a number of certain/uncertain parameters and predicts the optimum number of solar panels to be installed in the city of phoenix.

Business problem to be solved: 
Optimum number of solar panels to be installed in the city of phoenix. Each panel generates free electricity without any maintenance cost but has a rental associated with it. 

Deciding Factors:
Number of solar panels: Each panel has a fixed rental and generates electricity based on sunlight
Cloud-cover: Directly impacts sunlight
Demand
Cost Slab


Inputs:
Historic household electricity consumption
Cloud Cover
Electricity rates varying by day of week, time of day, season

Output
Optimum number of panels that minimize the overall cost
